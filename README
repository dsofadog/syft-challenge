# Things to note.


pleae check the git history and you will see that I have checked in allong the way.
You will see lots of duplication and class definitions with inthe tests.

Why ? Each test is seperate aapplication in my eyes so I copy an paste and amend
until then end I clean up. Depending on the test I would even leave the duplication in.
